# 📌 Introduction

Math AI Question Generator is a production-structured, full‑stack web application for practicing math problems with instant evaluation, step‑by‑step explanations, and AI‑generated similar questions. It is designed for correctness, clarity, and scalability.

This repository includes a React + Vite frontend, a FastAPI backend, a MongoDB question bank, and an AI generation service that uses the Groq LLM API.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- Python 3.9+ ([download](https://www.python.org/))
- MongoDB (local or Atlas) ([docs](https://www.mongodb.com/))
- Internet access for external API (Groq)

Supported OS: macOS, Linux, Windows 10/11.

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omprakash6353/math-ai-question-generator.git
cd math-ai-question-generator
```

2. Backend setup:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment:
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Frontend setup:

```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/` (do not commit secrets):

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

- GROQ_API_KEY: API key for Groq LLM access.
- MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string (use Atlas or local instance).

Follow best practices: use secret managers for production and restrict API key scopes.

---

## 📖 Usage

Start the backend (development):

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

- Backend: http://localhost:8000  
- Swagger UI (OpenAPI): http://localhost:8000/docs

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend (Vite): http://localhost:5173

---

## 🎯 API Endpoints

Standard endpoints provided by the backend:

- GET /questions — List questions (pagination as applicable)
- GET /question/{id} — Retrieve a single question by id
- POST /generate — Generate AI-similar questions

Request/response sample for answer evaluation:

```json
{
  "question": "string",
  "options": { "A": "...", "B": "...", "C": "...", "D": "..." },
  "correct": "A",
  "userAnswer": "B"
}
```

For AI generation, POST /generate accepts an existing question payload and returns two validated, similar questions with:
- question text
- options
- correct option
- explanation
- difficulty tag

Authentication, rate limiting, and input validation should be added before production use.

---

## 🖥️ Frontend UI Overview

- Card-based question view with:
  - Question text
  - Options A–D
  - Answer selection and visual locking
  - Step-by-step explanation panel
  - Buttons to generate and practice AI-generated questions
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Skeleton loaders while fetching data
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, ARIA where applicable

## 🧪 Testing

Backend tests (pytest):

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

- Aim for unit tests for validation, answer-checking logic, and AI output validation.
- Integration tests should cover API contracts and basic end-to-end flows.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- Backend not starting:
  - Verify virtual environment is active and Python version >= 3.9.
  - Check installed packages in requirements.txt.

- AI generation failing:
  - Confirm GROQ_API_KEY is set and has required access.
  - Inspect request/response logs for rate limits or schema issues.

- Frontend shows blank page:
  - Ensure backend is running and CORS is configured if the frontend consumes the API.
  - Check browser console for JS errors and Vite terminal for build errors.
